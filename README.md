# Mutation-Testing-Simulator

## MutantList.py
Take source code with mathematical operators
1. Generate txt file with all mutation sites and potential mutants
2. Create new files, 1 mutation inserted per file
3. Run fault simulation and kill mutants if their outputs differ from expected output
4. Run fault simulation in parallel to optimize run time
